## Overview
In this project we tried to execute a design integrating data received from two server-side API requests. We have used the National Park Service (NPS) API and Open Weather API to build this website. One of the major requirement of this project was to use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. We have used Bulma as a framework API. 

## Bulma 
Bulma is an open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that can be combined to build responsive websites. It uses the Flexbox layout and is really user friendly with extensive documentation on their site. 


## Hurdles and Pitfalls
Unlike the other homework assignments Project 1 gave us a chance to work collaboratively. Working in a group was fun. We divided the tasks among ourselves and used the GitHub projects for this. We practiced the Git workflow through out the project to make sure we won't end up in merge conflicts. 


## Conclusion
This project was a great experience to revisit all the topics we have learned so far. It helped us learn how to work collaboratively in a group and to practice the proper git workflow. We got comfortable working with server side APIs and effectively use the debugger tool to fix the errors that we found along the way.
